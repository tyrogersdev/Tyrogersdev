## About
I’m 20 and transitioning from body-shop estimating into cybersecurity. I’m keeping things simple and focused on **Identity & Access**—how people sign in, what they’re allowed to do, and how to keep that clean.

- 📍 Lexington, KY  
- 🎯 Target: **Entry-level IAM / identity support / junior admin**  
- 🧭 Approach: ship small labs, write plain-English notes, include screenshots

---

## What I’m learning (IAM first)
- ✅ **Accounts & roles:** who has access and why  
- ✅ **Sign-in basics:** what happens when you log in  
- ✅ **Least privilege:** only the access you need  
- ✅ **Reviews & JIT:** Access Reviews, PIM (turn access on only when needed)  
- 🧪 **Tokens at a glance:** very basic “who I am” vs “what I can do”

> I’m staying beginner-friendly on purpose. I’ll add depth as labs grow.

---

## Current Labs (small but real)
| Lab | What I did | Proof |
|---|---|---|
| **Entra ID – My First Lab** | Registered a test app, signed in, looked at tokens at a high level, and checked **Access Reviews** and **PIM**. | Screenshots in repo README (no code required) |
| **Entra – Access Reviews Quick Pass** *(planned)* | Create a group, add/remove members, run a review, capture results. | Screenshots |
| **Entra – PIM Basics** *(planned)* | Activate a role temporarily and confirm it logs/records. | Screenshots |

> I’ll keep these small and honest. Each one shows exactly what I did and what I learned.

---

## Roadmap (next few weeks)
- [ ] Add short “What I learned” bullets to each lab  
- [ ] Do a **portal-only** lab for group + role assignment (with screenshots)  
- [ ] Add one page explaining tokens in plain English  
- [ ] Optional: try **Graph Explorer** once (GET `/me`) and screenshot the result

---

## How to use my repos
- Open the lab README → follow the steps → compare with screenshots  
- Everything is simple and reproducible—no guesswork, no fluff
